The Bachelor's final year project centers on creating a streamlined private tuition system that effectively connects parents with tutors. The system is designed to enhance the educational experience by providing efficient tools and features for all stakeholders involved.

Administratively, the system empowers administrators to manage tutor profiles comprehensively, ensuring accurate representation of qualifications and expertise. Additionally, administrators oversee the distribution of E-books, enriching educational resources available to tutors and students alike.

For parents, the system simplifies the process of finding and selecting tutors through an intuitive interface. Parents can register, create profiles outlining their children's educational needs, search for suitable tutors based on various criteria such as subject proficiency and location, schedule demo sessions to evaluate teaching styles, and seamlessly book tutoring sessions online.

Tutors benefit from tools that facilitate efficient demo management, allowing them to accept or decline session requests based on availability. They can also manage their bookings and update their profiles to showcase qualifications and availability accurately.

Overall, this project aims to streamline the tutoring process, empower tutors with effective management tools, and aid parents in finding suitable educators for their children, thereby enhancing educational outcomes through accessible and efficient educational support.
